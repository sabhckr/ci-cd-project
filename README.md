CI/CD Project
This project demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Python-based application.

Project Overview
Application: A basic Python application located in the app/ directory.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated workflow defined in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.

Automation: On every push to the main branch, the pipeline installs dependencies and runs the application.
